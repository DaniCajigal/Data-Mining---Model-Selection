# Practice 1: Selection of models.

In this practice, the evaluation of two classifiers is performed on the Iris data set.

The classifiers used would be: LDA and KNN.

The performance of the classifiers is obtained from the confusion matrix.

The comparison of the models is carried out using the McNemar test and the 5x2cv test.

The evaluation of the McNemar test has been carried out in R, while the 5x2cv test has been carried out in Python.
